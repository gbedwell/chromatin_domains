## Analyzing TSA-seq data with HMMs

This repository contains the processing requirements for generating associated coordinates from TSA-seq data using Hidden Markov Models.

The data normalization and smoothing steps are described in [Zhang, et. al.](10.1101/gr.266239.120). This paper points to two GitHub repositories. The [first](https://github.com/zocean/Norma/tree/master/TSA-seq_2.0) provides scripts, descriptions, and examples of read mapping and data normalization. The [second](https://github.com/lgchang27/TSA-Seq-2020v2) provides scripts, descriptions, and examples of data smoothing. These scripts are updated relative to the [original SPAD/TSA-seq publication](10.1101/gr.266239.120). Note that this second repository also contains the steps and scripts required for cytological distance calculations, SPAD identification using their quantile-based approach, and more.
