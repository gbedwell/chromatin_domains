## Analyzing TSA-seq data with HMMs

This repository contains the scripts necessary for calling marker-associated regions from TSA-seq data using Hidden Markov Models.

The data normalization and smoothing steps are described in [Zhang, et. al.](10.1101/gr.266239.120). This paper points to two GitHub repositories. The [first](https://github.com/zocean/Norma/tree/master/TSA-seq_2.0) provides scripts, descriptions, and examples of read mapping and data normalization. The [second](https://github.com/lgchang27/TSA-Seq-2020v2) provides scripts, descriptions, and examples of data smoothing. There are additional functionalities available in the second repo as well, but for my purposes, the scripts for data normalization and data smoothing were sufficient.
